/*Instructions: It's always polite to ask your user if they are ready to play.
Using the confirm command, make sure your user is ready to play. For example, I would use the sentence "I am ready to play!". Add whatever phrase you would like in the confirm.*/
// Check if the user is ready to play!
confirm("Are you ready to play?");

/*Instructions: Under the existing code, declare a variable age.
Make age equal to prompt("What's your age");. See the example above.
Then write an if/else statement. If age is less than 13, use alert to tell the user that they're allowed to play but you take no responsibility.
Else, use alert and give them an encouraging message to play on!*/

/*Instructions: Print the introduction using alert. Remember that the introduction is a string, so make sure to keep it between quotes.*/

/*Instructions: Under your existing code, print out the storyline: "Suddenly, Bieber stops and says, 'Who wants to race me?'"
Then declare a variable userAnswer. Make it equal a prompt that asks the user "Do you want to race Bieber on stage?". This will be the question that you ask your user.*/

Make sure to check the console for error messages and suggestions for how to fix them.*/

/*Instructions: Create a variable called feedback and prompt the user to rate your game out of 10.
If feedback is greater than 8, print out: "Thank you! We should race at the next concert!"
Otherwise, print out:
"I'll keep practicing coding and racing."*/
