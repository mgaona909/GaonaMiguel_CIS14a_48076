/*Instructions: Use five console.log statements to print out the numbers 1 to 5.
Try not getting angry at me for this annoying exercise.
Head over to the next exercise to see how we can use for loops to do this task more efficiently.*/
console.log(1);
console.log(2);
console.log(3);
console.log(4);
console.log(5);
/*Instructions: The for loop in the code will print out 1 to 5 and use far less code than you used in the previous exercise.
Change the 6 to 11 and press Save & Submit Code. This will see the computer print out 1 to 10!*/
for (var counter = 1; counter < 11; counter++) {
	console.log(counter);
}
/*Instructions: This for loop starts off at 1 and will end at 10.
Change the for loop such that it will start off at 5!*/
for (var i = 5; i < 11; i = i + 1){
	console.log(i);
}
/*Instructions: We know this for loop counts from 1 to 10.
Change this for loop such that it starts at 4.
Change this for loop such that it counts up to and including 23. ( i.e. we do NOT want 24 to be printed out!)
Run your for loop and see it count from 4 to 23!*/
for (var i = 4; i <= 23; i = i + 1) {
	console.log(i);
}
/*Instructions: This code counts every number from 0 to 35.
Make it start counting from 5. Please!
Stop the counting when it prints out 50.
Only count every fifth number. So we want to increment i by 5.*/
for (var i = 5; i < 51; i+=5) {
	console.log(i);
}
/*Instructions: Make the computer start counting at 8.
Keep counting while i < 120.
Count up by increments of 12.*/
for (var i = 8 ; i < 120; i+=12) {
	console.log(i);
}
/*Instructions: Change this code such that it starts counting from 10.
We want it to stop once it gets to 0.
We want it to count down by 1.*/
for (var i = 10; i >= 0; i--) {
	console.log(i);
}
/*Instructions: Once more, for practice: write a for loop that gets the computer to count down from 100 until 0 by 5. This time, make sure not to print 0.*/
for (var i=100; i>0; i-=5)
{
    console.log(i);
}
/*Instructions: Declare it using var.
Put [ ] around your data.
Separate each bit of data with a comma.
End it with a semi-colon.
Use console.log to print out junk.*/
var junk = ["stuff","things",4,5];
/*Instructions: Print out the fourth element of the array. 
1. Start with figuring out how to express what the fourth element in the array is.
2. Then use console.log() to print things out!*/
var junkData = ["Eddie Murphy", 49, "peanuts", 31];
console.log(junkData[3]);
/*Instructions: Change the elements in the cities array. You can put in as many elements as you like.
Run the for loop and see them all printed out!*/
var cities = ["Melbourne", "Amman", "Helsinki", "NYC","London","Paris"];

for (var i = 0; i < cities.length; i++) {
    console.log("I would like to visit " + cities[i]);
}
/*Instructions: Create an array called names filled with 5 names.
Write a for loop that prints "I know someone called " followed by names[i]. Make sure there's a space between "called" and the name!
Run your code and the five sentences should print out.*/
var names = ["Miguel", "Bob", "Rob", "Ed", "Ned"];

for (i=0; i<5; i++)
{
    console.log("I know someone called " + names[i]);
