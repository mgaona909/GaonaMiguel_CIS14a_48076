//Instructions: Write your name within quotes like this: "Ryan" Then click "Save & Submit Code".
"Miguel"

/*Instructions: To discover the length of your name write your name within quotes. Then write a period (full stop) and the word length like this:
"yourName".length
When you're done click Save & Submit Code 
(Do this from now on every time you finish your exercise.).
In my case (my name is Leng) it would be "Leng".length*/
"Miguel".length

//Instructions: Add any two numbers, like this: 3 + 4
3+45

//Instructions: You can use * for multiplication and / for division if you want. Enter another valid expression to pass this lesson.
5*9

//Instructions: Try to confuse the interpreter by using a word it doesn't know, like eggplant. It will give you a ReferenceError.
eggplant

/*Instructions: The computer will ignore the code on lines 1-2, since it is commented out.
On line 3, find the length of the word "cake".*/
// This is a comment that the computer will ignore. 
// It is for your eyes only!
"cake".length

//Instructions: Write your own message that you want the user to confirm.
confirm("This is awesome")

//Instructions: Use the prompt command to ask the user where they are from. Check out the examples above for how to do this!
prompt("Where are you from?")

/*Instructions: Write a string with at least 3 words. Check out the examples of strings above.
Find the length of the string by writing a period (full stop) and the word length, like this:
"string".length
Length counts every character in the string - including spaces!*/
"hello there bob".length

/*Instructions: Let's compare two numbers to return a true result:

First, write the string "I'm coding like a champ"
Next, find the length of the string using .length
Then, compare the string's length to see if it is greater than 10
If you want to check your code, click "Stuck? Get a hint!" below.*/
"I'm coding like a champ!".length>10

/*Instructions: Please print the following two console.log statements at the same time. Type one on line 1 and the other on line 2. Then press Save & Submit Code.
console.log(2 * 5)
console.log("Hello")*/
console.log(2*5)
console.log("Hello")

/*Instructions: Try to use each of the operators above.

Choose the correct comparison operator to make each of the four statements print out true.*/
console.log(15 > 4);
console.log("Xiao Hui".length < 122);
console.log("Goody Donaldson".length > 8);
console.log(8*2 == 16);
console.log(5==4)
console.log(2==5)

/*Instructions: Check out the if statement in the editor.

On line 1, add a condition inside the parentheses ( ).
If the answer to the condition is yes, the code inside the curly braces will run. So on line 2, use console.log to print out a string.*/
if ( 100 > 2 )
{
    console.log("You are good at math!");
}
console.log("Just letting you know: your program got to line 6");

/*Instructions: In line 1, fill in a condition that will evaluate to false
Fill in some code to run in the else portion (this will run if the condition is false). Use console.log for this part.*/
if ("word".length > 7) 
{
    alert("Let's go down the first road!");
}
else 
{
    // What should we do if the condition is false? Fill in here:
    console.log("Let's go down the second road!")
}

/*Instructions: Write an if/else statement, just like we did in the last exercise. Here's what the outline of the code looked like:
if (condition) 
{
    // if condition is true
    // do this code
}
else // "otherwise"
{
    // do this code instead
}
If your condition is true, use console.log to print "The condition is true".
Otherwise (else) when it is false, use console.log to print "The condition is false".
Make sure your condition evaluates to false, so that your program prints out "The condition is false".*/
if ("hello world".length < 5)
{
    console.log ("The condition is true.")
}
else
{
    console.log ("The condition is false.")
}

/*Instructions: There are many mistakes in this code. Find them and fix them all.
You are doing what's called "debugging," a term popularized by Grace Hopper when she literally removed a moth from her computer.*/
if (10 === 10){
    console.log("You got a true!")
}
else {
    console.log("You got a false!")
}

/*Instructions: Complete the missing bits of code to construct the if / else statement. Make the condition evaluate to true.
Finish the else statement by printing out the string "Error Error Error" to the console.*/
if ("Jon".length * 2 / (2+1) === 2)
{
    console.log("The answer makes sense!");
} 
else 
{
    console.log("Error Error Error")
}

/*Instructions: Use console.log and modulo three times to print the remainder of the following equations:
a. 14 / 3
b. 99 / 8
c. 11 / 3    */
console.log(14%3);
console.log(99%8);
console.log(11%3);

/*Instructions: Let's get the if/else" statement to display "The first number is even".

Edit line 5 by adding a comparison that evaluates to true.
In the comparison, use a modulo and an even number, like we did in the example above.*/
if(20%2===0) 
{
    console.log("The first number is even");
} 
else 
{
    console.log("The first number is odd");
}

/*Instructions: Find the 4th up to and including the 7th letter of the string "wonderful day".*/
"wonderful day".substring(3,7);

/*Instructions: Using console.log, on three separate lines, print out the substrings for the following strings.

a. "Jan" in "January"
b. "Melbourne is" in "Melbourne is great" (note the space!)
c. "burgers" in "Hamburgers" */
console.log("January".substring(0,3));
console.log("Melbourne is great".substring(0,12));
console.log("Hamburgers".substring(3,10));

/*Instructions: Create a variable called myAge and type in your age.*/
var myAge = 20;
console.log(myAge);

/*Instructions: Follow the instructions in the comments in the code to continue.*/
// Declare a variable on line 3 called
// myCountry and give it a string value.
var myCountry = "Oceania";

// Use console.log to print out the length of the variable myCountry.
console.log(myCountry.length);

// Use console.log to print out the first three letters of myCountry.
console.log(myCountry.substring(0,3));

/*Instructions: Follow the instructions on line 1, line 3, line 5 and line 8. We're using this method to show you the order in which you tell the computer what to do is very important.*/
// On line 2, declare a variable myName and give it your name.
var myName = "Miguel";
// On line 4, use console.log to print out the myName variable
console.log(myName)
// On line 7, change the value of myName to be just the first 2 // letters of your name.
myName = "Mi";
// On line 9, use console.log to print out the myName variable.
console.log(myName);

/*Instructions: On line 1, create a variable myColor and give it a string value.
On line 2, print the length of myColor to the console.*/
var myColor = "red";
console.log(myColor.length);

/*Instructions: Write your own if / else statement.
The only instruction is that the result of evaluating the statement is a log to the console of "I finished my first course!".*/
var complete = true;

if (complete===true)
{
    console.log("I finished my first course!");
}
else
{
    console.log("boo");
