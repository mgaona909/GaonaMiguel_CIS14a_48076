//Instructions: Write your name within quotes like this: "Ryan" Then click "Save & Submit Code".
"Miguel"

/*Instructions: To discover the length of your name write your name within quotes. Then write a period (full stop) and the word length like this:
"yourName".length
When you're done click Save & Submit Code 
(Do this from now on every time you finish your exercise.).
In my case (my name is Leng) it would be "Leng".length*/
"Miguel".length

//Instructions: Add any two numbers, like this: 3 + 4
3+45

//Instructions: You can use * for multiplication and / for division if you want. Enter another valid expression to pass this lesson.
5*9

//Instructions: Try to confuse the interpreter by using a word it doesn't know, like eggplant. It will give you a ReferenceError.
eggplant

/*Instructions: The computer will ignore the code on lines 1-2, since it is commented out.
On line 3, find the length of the word "cake".*/
// This is a comment that the computer will ignore. 
// It is for your eyes only!
"cake".length

//Instructions: Write your own message that you want the user to confirm.
confirm("This is awesome")

prompt("Where are you from?")

/*Instructions: Write a string with at least 3 words. Check out the examples of strings above.
Find the length of the string by writing a period (full stop) and the word length, like this:
"string".length
Length counts every character in the string - including spaces!*/
"hello there bob".length

/*Instructions: Let's compare two numbers to return a true result:

First, write the string "I'm coding like a champ"
Next, find the length of the string using .length
Then, compare the string's length to see if it is greater than 10
If you want to check your code, click "Stuck? Get a hint!" below.*/
"I'm coding like a champ!".length>10
