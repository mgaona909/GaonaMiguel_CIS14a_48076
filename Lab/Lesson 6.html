/*Instructions: Declare and set the following three variables:
text, and make it a string containing some text. Place your name in there a couple of times!
myName, and make it a string containing just your name.
hits, and make it an empty array.*/
/*Instructions: Below your existing code, create a for loop that starts at 0, continues until it reaches the end of text, and increments by 1 each time. (This means it will check each character in the string.) There's no need to write anything between the {}s of your loop just yet.*/
/*Instructions: Add your if statement in the body of your for loop. It should check to see whether the current letter is equal to the first letter of your name. */
/*Instructions: Okay! Go ahead and add that second for loop inside the body of your if statement.*/
/*Instructions: Under your existing code (and outside all your loops!), set up an if/else statement. If you don't have any hits, log "Your name wasn't found!" to the console. Otherwise, log the hits array to the console.*/
/*Instructions: In the meantime, click Save & Submit Code to finish this course and move on to more JavaScript goodness.*/
